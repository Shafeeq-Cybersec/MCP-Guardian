"""Detector base class and shared primitives.

Every detector is a self-contained plugin that inspects normalized content and
emits zero or more :class:`DetectionSignal`. Detectors declare a capability
tier so the engine can report which upgrades (ML models) are active, but a
detector must *always* produce a usable heuristic result even when its optional
model is unavailable.
